# Implementing a Redis Clone in Zig

Redis is an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. This guide will walk you through building your own Redis server capable of handling various operations, protocols, and features similar to those found in Redis.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Zig programming language.
- Basic knowledge of TCP/IP networking.
- Understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from [the official Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/).

## Stages

### Stage 1: Setting Up the Project

First, create a new directory for your project and initialize it with Zig:

```bash
mkdir redis_clone && cd redis_clone
zim init.
```

### Stage 2: Binding to a Port

**Objective:** Establish a TCP connection and bind your server to a specified port.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const net = std.net;

pub fn main()void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = &gpa.allocator;
    
    var server = try net.StreamServer.init(.{.reuse_address = true });
    defer server.deinit();
    
    try server.listen(allocator, "127.0.0.1", 6379);
}
```

### Stage 3: Responding to PING

**Objective:** Implement the basic PING command.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Inside the server.listen callback
if (client.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(allocator, "\n") catch |err| {
    // Handle error
}) else |line| {
    if (std.mem.eql(u8, line, "PING\r\n")) {
        try client.writeAll("PONG\r\n");
    }
}
```

### Stage 4: Handling Multiple PINGs

**Objective:** Handle multiple consecutive PING requests.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Similar to Stage 3, but inside a loop or event-driven model
while (true) {
    // Check for new client connections or incoming data
}
```

### Stage 5: Managing Concurrent Clients

**Objective:** Manage multiple client connections simultaneously.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Use an async runtime or threads to handle multiple clients concurrently
try server.accept().then(|client| {
    // Handle client connection
});
```

### Stage 6: Implementing the ECHO Command

**Objective:** Echo back received messages.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Inside the server.listen callback
if (std.mem.eql(u8, line, "ECHO\r\n")) {
    try client.writeAll(line);
} else {
    // Parse and execute the command
}
```

### Stage 7: Implementing the SET & GET Commands

**Objective:** Store and retrieve key-value pairs.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Inside the server.listen callback
else {
    // Parse the command into operation and arguments
    // Execute SET or GET based on the operation
}
```

### Stage 8: Implementing Key Expiry

**Objective:** Implement key expiration.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// When setting a key, record its expiry time
// Periodically check and remove expired keys
```

### Stage 9: Implementing Replication

**Objective:** Set up a replication listener.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Listen for incoming connections from replicas
server.listen(allocator, "127.0.0.1", 6380); // Different port for replicas
```

### Stage 10: Providing System Information

**Objective:** Return detailed information about the server's state.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Implement a command handler for INFO
```

### Stage 11: Maintaining Replication State

**Objective:** Each replica needs to know its initial position in the master's log to start replicating correctly.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// During the handshake, exchange initial positions
```

### Stage 12: Sending and Receiving Handshakes

**Objective:** Perform the initial part of the replication handshake.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Master sends initial part of handshake
// Replica responds with its initial position
```

### Stage 13: Reading RDB Files

**Objective:** Retrieve values from RDB files.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Load RDB file and parse keys/values
```

### Stage 14: Implementing Streams

**Objective:** Allow users to create streams and add entries.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Create a new stream
// Add entries to the stream
```

### Stage 15: Blocking Reads

**Objective:** Implement blocking reads for streams.

**Code Snippet:**

```zig
// Implement XREAD command for non-blocking reads
```

## Conclusion

Building a Redis clone in Zig offers a deep dive into network programming, concurrency, and data storage mechanisms. Each stage introduces new challenges and learning opportunities, culminating in a functional, albeit simplified, version of Redis.

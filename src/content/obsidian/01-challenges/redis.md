# Implementing a Redis Clone in Zig

Redis is an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. This guide will walk you through building your own Redis server capable of handling various operations, protocols, and features similar to those found in Redis.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Zig programming language.
- Basic knowledge of TCP/IP networking.
- Understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from [the official Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/).

## Stage 1: Setting Up the Project

Initialize a new project directory and set up the necessary files and directories.

```bash
mkdir redis_clone && cd redis_clone zim init .
```

## Stage 2: Binding to a Port

Establish a TCP connection and bind your server to a specified port.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const net = std.net;

pub fn main() void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = &gpa.allocator;
    
    var server = try net.StreamServer.init(.{.reuse_address = true });
    defer server.deinit();
    
    try server.listen(allocator, "127.0.0.1", 6379);
}
```

## Stage 3: Responding to PING

Implement the basic PING command to test connectivity.

```zig
// Inside the server.listen callback
if (client.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(allocator, "\n") catch |err| {
    // Handle error
}) else |line| {
    if (std.mem.eql(u8, line, "PING\r\n")) {
        try client.writeAll("PONG\r\n");
    }
}
```

## Stage 4: Handling Multiple PINGs

Ensure the server can handle multiple consecutive PING requests gracefully.

```zig
// Similar to Stage 3, but inside a loop or event-driven model
while (true) {
    // Check for new client connections or incoming data
}
```

## Stage 5: Managing Concurrent Clients

Implement logic to manage multiple client connections simultaneously.

```zig
// Use an async runtime or threads to handle multiple clients concurrently
try server.accept().then(|client| {
    // Handle client connection
});
```

## Stage 6: Implementing the ECHO Command

Echo back received messages to simulate a simple command execution.

```zig
// Inside the server.listen callback
if (std.mem.eql(u8, line, "ECHO\r\n")) {
    try client.writeAll(line);
} else {
    // Parse and execute the command
}
```

## Stage 7: Implementing the SET & GET Commands

Implement basic CRUD operations for storing and retrieving key-value pairs.

```zig
// Inside the server.listen callback
else {
    // Parse the command into operation and arguments
    // Execute SET or GET based on the operation
}
```

## Stage 8: Implementing Key Expiry

Introduce key expiration functionality to automatically delete expired keys.

```zig
// When setting a key, record its expiry time
// Periodically check and remove expired keys
```

## Stage 9: Implementing Replication

Set up a replication mechanism to maintain data consistency across servers.

```zig
// Listen for incoming connections from replicas
[]()server.listen(allocator, "127.0.0.1", 6380); // Different port for replicas
```

## Stage 10: Providing System Information

Implement a command to return detailed information about the server's state.

```zig
// Implement a command handler for INFO
```

## Stage 11: Maintaining Replication State

Ensure each replica knows its initial position in the master's log for correct replication.

```zig
// During the handshake, exchange initial positions
```

## Stage 12: Sending and Receiving Handshakes

Perform the initial part of the replication handshake between master and replicas.

```zig
// Master sends initial part of handshake
// Replica responds with its initial position
```

## Stage 13: Reading RDB Files

Implement functionality to load and parse values from RDB files.

```zig
// Load RDB file and parse keys/values
```

## Stage 14: Implementing Streams

Allow users to create streams and add entries for efficient data processing.

```zig
// Create a new stream
// Add entries to the stream
```

## Stage 15: Blocking Reads

Implement blocking reads for streams to support non-blocking read operations.

```zig
// Implement XREAD command for non-blocking reads
```
